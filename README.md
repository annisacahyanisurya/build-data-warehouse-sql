# 🚀 Build Data Warehouse with Medallion Architecture

## 📊 Project Overview 

This project focuses on building a functional Data Warehouse using SQL Server, implementing the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers). The goal was to simulate a professional ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline, transforming raw, inconsistent data into high-quality, analysis-ready tables.

_**Disclaimer** : This project was developed as part of an independent study following the roadmap provided by [Data with Baraa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GVqKuTVANE&list=PLh9iCKOuzdYFmCWbUsxdNiJ8X2KeWm-kN&index=28). I manually implemented the scripts, debugged technical issues, and documented the logic behind each transformation layer._
